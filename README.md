  ## Tools and 3rd party assistance
  * Influenced with the week 14 MVC mini-project code. 
  * Student AI tool and ChatGPT for creating routes and learning more about creating relationships between models. 
  * Office hours with the Instructor Josh Naylor for getting comments working and posting new blog posts. 

  ## Obstacles and Successes
  * Easily the hardest homework yet for me starting from scratch and building a full stack app. 
  * Learning how to get all the models and views working correctly.
  * Working with Partials and Helpers.

  * I was able to make a pretty accurate file tree and get alot of the initial code going including: Routes, login authentication, Models, and Views.
  * Some styling was done but i ran out of time. Too many hours spent trying to get it right. 
  * The app is functional it just doesn't look great.
